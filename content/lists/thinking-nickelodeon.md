# DO

* Play.
* Have Fun.
* Know the kid inside you. Use her/his voice, not the voice of a parent talking to a kid.
* Understand it's tough to be a kid in the adult world.
* Empower kids by giving them a voice, respect, a chance to speak up.
* Be honest.
* Innovate.
* Take risks.
* Make people feel something, any emotional response is good.
* Be subversive.
* Be sure there is an idea, a concept behind every design.
* Be REBELLIOUS, OBNOXIOUS, MISCHIEVOUS, CONSPIRATORIAL, IRREVERENT, PLAYFUL.
* When in doubt, use more.
* Be good, but not "precious."
* Use the logo in multiple, large, active ways.
* Reinvent cliche.
* Stand up for what you belive in, even if you're the little guy.
* Be simple.
* Use parody, kids understand it.
* Create a mythology: Give an idea a history, a story behind the story.
* Let kids be kids.
* Be loud, but not just for loudness' sake.
* Do the thing you wanted to do when you were ten but weren't allowed to.
* Use real, oridinary kids--not perfect kids.
* Be a kid's ally.
* Be a rabble rouser.
* Celebrate Mess!

# DON'T

* Don't talk down to kids or use kiddi-ized copy.
* Don't overpromise. Don't make promises you can't keep.
* Don't use role models or perfect kids, they make real kids feel inadequate and imperfect.
* Don't use the logo as a static thing or slap it in a corner, integrate the logo into your design.
* Don't be afraid to take a classic graphic form and make it kid-like.
* Don't be afraid to create new logo shapes.
* Don't be afraid to be self-deprecating.
* Don't be afraid to get it wrong.

# BEWARE

* Of creating stuff that adults think kids want and not what kids really want.
* Of thinking you know kids' slang, it comes and goes too fast.
* If it doesn't make you feel something, trash it.

\* These are not hard and fast rules, there are no hard and fast rules.
