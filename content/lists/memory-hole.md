## TV Shows

- The Power Team (1990)
  * Vague memories of video game characters standing in the back of a monster
    truck.
  * Thought it had Pac-Man in it, but it was actually Kwirk.
  * Fixated on the idea of it having Conan in it, but it was actually Kuros from
    Wizards & Warriors.
  * The reveal was searching for Wizards & Warriors and finding a mention of the
    show in it's wiki page. No idea how that came to me, but it probably was
    from the last time I tried to find it.
